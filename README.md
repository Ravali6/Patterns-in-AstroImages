# Patterns-in-AstroImages
The images captured by the telescopes contains many contrants to analyse as the images vary this the time, number od discs uses, types of noises, Point-Spread Functions. This project is mainly focusing on using a Convolutional Neural Network to find the patterns in the images.
Step1: finding the images with patterns and without(classification problem)
Step2: finding images with multiple(2-3) patterns combined and naming them accordingly

# Data Analysis
Generated Synthetic data: Dr.Urvashi help me to generate the synthetic data with variations paossible in them.
About Data: Data is an astronomical image with the bunch of shining objects in them with/without patterns, with/without noises, time & position considerations.



# AI
Basic Neural Net: Developed a basic neural net to get the assured performance for the classification task.
CNN: Convolution Neural Net
